## Introduction
The **BMI Calculator** app is a simple mobile application developed with Flutter that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height inputs. BMI is a widely used measure to assess whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. This app provides a user-friendly interface to input weight and height, calculate BMI, and view the result with an interpretation of the BMI category.

## Features
- Calculate BMI based on weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
- Provide an interpretation of the BMI result (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
